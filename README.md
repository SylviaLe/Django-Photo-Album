A personal digital album app developed using Django framework

<img src="screenshot-1.png" width = 600px />
<img src="screenshot-2.png" width = 600px />
<img src="screenshot-3.png" width = 600px />

## Installation & Usage

I highly recommend creating a blank Django project and copy the code there, since I have hidden the Django key for production stage

## Problems and Future update

Deploy this project on Heroku and make sure everything runs smoothly
